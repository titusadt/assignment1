			<ul>
				<li>At first I found this assignment really difficult to do because I have never coded in html or even really seen what it looks like and format is nothing like python or c++, but it kind of made sense after looking at the lecture notes and basically copying and pasting what was there to see how it ran. I also had no idea how to run the code until I looked in piazza and saw the answers that were given to other people. It wasnt so bad for a first time experience. </li>
