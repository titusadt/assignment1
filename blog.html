		<h2>Assingment 1</h>
			<ul>
				<li>At first I found this assignment really difficult to do because I have never coded in html or even really seen what it looks like and format is nothing like python or c++, but it kind of made sense after looking at the lecture notes and basically copying and pasting what was there to see how it ran. I also had no idea how to run the code until I looked in piazza and saw the answers that were given to other people. It wasnt so bad for a first time experience. </li>
			</ul>
 <h3>Assignment 2</h>
                         <ul>
                                 <li>This assignment was also a pretty new experince for me because I have never coded in css. I had a lot of fun doing it because     I felt like an actual programmer, if that makes any sense.</li>
                                <li>The biggest challenge in this assignment was definitley the alignment of the twits, everytime I changed a little thing it mes    sed everything up. I went to office hours to get help from most of them and that was how I was able to fix them. I also read up a bunch of websites about flexbox    es and I may have some ideas about it now </li>
                                 <li>I also watched the lectures like youtube videos lol. I watched them as I coded. I tried reading notes before I started the as    signment but I realised it made no sense to me unles it was actually explained verbally to me so I returned to the lectures.</li>
                                 <li> I googled a lot about flexboxes and and looked at the mocks after every single change that was made to the code to see if it     looked the same.</li>

<h3>Assignment 3</h>
			<ul>
				<li>This assignment was not that bad, I found most of the intrsuctions easy to carry out like hiding the modal and clearing all the text and cancelling the modal, so I got that done in no time. The really challenging part of the assignment was printing the twit to the screen and making the search button. I was not able to print the tweets successfully cause my twit container had some missing elements so it did not look exactly like the one in the prompt but it was still pretty close. I got a lot of help from office hours, google and rewatching the lecture. i also reached out to some of my friends in class on parts i got stuck on. Overall is think it was a really fun program to make, it took a lot of time for me to complete tho but I got it somewhat done.</li>
